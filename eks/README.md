# Terraform Configuring Providers 

Remember to configure your local terraform instance to work with the provider we want. 

For google: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/getting_started


For AWS: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs

This just needs to be done once to ensure the executing environment has the proper access to deletate to terraform to perform the resource operations in the right place. 



# Future State
